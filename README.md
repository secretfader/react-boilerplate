# React Boilerplate

This is an opinionated React boilerplate, designed as a starting place for web
applications that we build at [Until Now](http://untilnow.co).

As of this writing, it only supports client side rendering &mdash; but that will
eventually change.

## Getting Started

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server, and automatically reload CSS files when
they change.

```
npm run compile
```

Build the application before running in a production deploy.

## Tools

* [Express](http://expressjs.com)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
* [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)
* [AVA](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io)

## Opinions

**Minimal overhead, for maximum flexiblity.**

We must choose the best tools, even if that means higher churn early on, in
hopes that it will reduce churn as development stabilizes later.

**Real world use matters more than speculation.**

In the JavaScript echo chamber, much is made of hot new tools even if they only
live a few months. Keep it simple, and make decisions on technical reasons...
don't use a tool just because it's new and shiny.
